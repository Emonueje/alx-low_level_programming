# README FOR PROJECT 0X09. C-STATIC LIBRARIES
I was introduced to the concept of static libraries in C programming language,
given resources to better understand the concepts and then given tasks to perform
so I can fully utilise the knowledge of static libraries in C programming.
## LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After this project I should:
- Know what a static library is
- How it works
- How to create one and know
- How to use it
## PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
As usual I was required to meet some specifications to be able to complete this project.
Requirements such as using a specific editor, using certain gcc flags during compilation
using a linter to ensure my code is formatted properly, not using any standard library functions etc.

In this project I was required to write a bash script.
## TASKS
This project has only two tasks:
0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
	- I am to create a static library libmy.a containing all the functions listed.
1. Without libraries What have we? We have no past and no future
	- Create a script called create\_static\_lib.sh that creates a static library 
	called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
