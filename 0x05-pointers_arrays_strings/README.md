# 0x05. C-POINTERS, ARRAYS AND STRINGS

For this project I had to grasp the concepts of pointers, arrays and data structures in C programming.

## Learning Objectives

- I should be able to use pointers.
- I should know what arrays are and how to use them.
- What are the differences between pointers and arrays
- How to use strings and how to manipulate them
- Scope of variables

To get the objectives I would perform the following tasks:
1. 98 Battert st.
2. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream.
3. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read.
4. I do not fear computers, I fear the lack of them.
5. I can only go one way> I've nt=ot got a reverse gear.
6. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes.
7. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true.
8. Winig is only half of it. Having fun is the other half
9. Arrays are not pointers
10. Strcpy

This project also includes two adavanced task that would be accessed only when I complete the mandatory tasks above.
