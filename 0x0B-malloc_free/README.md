# 0x0B. C-malloc, free
I was introduced to the concept of automatic and dynamic allocation, malloc and free (memory deallocation)
## LEARNING OBJECTIVES
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain in simple terms to anyone, and without the 
aid of google the following:
- What the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation is
- What malloc and free is and how to use them appropriately
- Why and when to use mallloc
- Finally how to use valgrind to check for memory leak
## TASKS
This project contains the following tasks:
0. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee
	- Write a function that create an array of chars, and initializer it with a specific char.
1. The woman who has no imagination has no wings
	- Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a
copy of the string given as a parameter.
2. He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life
	- Write a function that concatenated two strings
3. If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize
	- Write a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers
4. It's not bragging if you can back it up
	- Write a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by you alloc\_grid.c function
This project contains two advanced tasks that I would unlock when I complete the mandatory tasks above.
