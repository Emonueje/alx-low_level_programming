#ALx Project 0x03. C-Debugging
## Learning objectives 
- What debugging is
- What methods are used to deubug codes manually
- How to read error messages

I performes tasks that helped me practically debug in order of attempting the task include:
- 0. Multiple mains
- 1. Like, comment, subscribe
- 2. 0 > 972?
- 3. Leap year

Programming is beautiful and I love it. But it gets overwhelming and so frustrating especially
beginners like myself when ever there is an error. So I enjoyed every bit of this project. I am
not a perfect debugger _yet_ but I know I can debug my codes.
