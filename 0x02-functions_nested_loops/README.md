#PROJECT 0X02.C-FUNCTIONS, NESTED LOOPS
##I have been able to learn the following through this project:
- nested loops and how to use them.
- functions and how to use them.
- the difference between declaration and definition of a function.
- what a function prototype is 
- scopes of variables
- what the following flags: -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89 mean when using the gcc command
- What header files are and how to use them with #include.

I think I need to  get more serious with the course because  its beginning to get pretty intense
