# oxo7.C -Even more pointers, arrays and strings
I have moved from knowing nothing about C programming language to writing standard functions just in 3 weeks.
Thanks to ALx.
## The learning objectives of this project
- To know what pointers to pointers are and how to use them
- What multidimensional arrays are and how to use them
- What the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings
## Requirements for the tasks
I was instructed to use some specifications as a linter a specific editor and not allowed to use
any standard library functions as I was expected to write my own functions from scratch.
## Tasks
0. memset: Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte.
1. memcpy: Write a fucntion that copies memory area.
2. strchr: Write a function that locates character in a string.
3. strspn: Write a function that gets the length of a prfix substring.
4. strpbrk: Write a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
5. strstr: Write a function that locates a substring.
6. Chess is mental torture: Write a function that prints the chessboard.

This project contains 2 advanced tasks that I would unlock if I am done with the mandatory task above.
