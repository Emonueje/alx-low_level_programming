# 0x05. C-POINTERS, ARRAYS AND STRINGS

For this project I had to grasp the concepts of pointers, arrays and data structures in C programming.

## Learning Objectives

- I should be able to use pointers.
- I should know what arrays are and how to use them.
- What are the differences between pointers and arrays
- How to use strings and how to manipulate them
- Scope of variables

To get the objectives I would perform the following tasks:
- 0. 98 Battert st.
- 1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream.
- 2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read.
- 3. I do not fear computers, I fear the lack of them.
- 4. I can only go one way> I've nt=ot got a reverse gear.
- 5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes.
- 6.Half the lies they tell about me aren't true.
- 7. Winig is only half of it. Having fun is the other half
- 8.Arrays are not pointers
- 9.Strcpy

This project also includes two adavanced task that would be accessed only when I complete the mandatory tasks above.
